Meet Sally: Your Gentle Well-being Buddy üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sally is more than just a chatbot; she's a supportive, calming presence designed to boost your well-being.

In a world full of noisy, complex apps, Sally is built to be a simple, gentle, and accessible escape. Her interface is clean, minimal, and deliberately soothing, using soft colors and subtle animations to create a genuinely tranquil experience.

What makes Sally special?

A Gentle Friend: Sally is programmed with a warm, supportive, and non-judgmental tone. Think of her as a kind friend or trusted confidante you can turn to when you need to process your thoughts or just need a little encouragement.

The Power of Connection: Uniquely, Sally lets you define your relationship with her (like a "Sister," "Brother," or "Friend"). This shapes the conversation just enough to make your interaction feel more personal and empathetic.

Clean and Calm Design: Built with React and Vite, the frontend is fast, responsive, and focuses on accessibility. There's a calming light/dark theme, and subtle features like the aura and typing indicators respect your system's "reduced motion" settings for a truly comfortable experience.

Under the Hood (Simple & Stable) ‚öôÔ∏è
While the experience is simple, the engine is robust and modern:

Brain Power: Sally uses the intelligence of OpenAI's Chat Completions (like the powerful gpt-4o-mini model) to generate her supportive replies.

Secure Backbone: A fast, modular FastAPI backend securely handles all the communication with OpenAI. This keeps your secret key safe and sound on the server side, ensuring a secure and reliable experience.

Flexible Chat: You have the choice between getting instant, full replies or watching Sally's message appear in real-time with streaming (SSE)‚Äîjust like a real conversation!

Getting Started is Easy!

If you're a developer, you can get this calming experience running locally in minutes:

Get the Parts: Install your standard Node.js (for the frontend) and Python (for the backend) dependencies.

Add the Key: Pop your secure OpenAI API Key into the private backend configuration.

Launch: A single command (npm run dev) starts both the frontend interface and the secure backend server.

Sally is ready to be a calming cornerstone for any app or just a delightful, supportive tool for yourself. Dive in and feel the difference a gentle interface can make!
